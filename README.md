# chatbot-tourism

my chatbot project was part of my NLP-AI course, during my academic studies. 
In this project, I developed a chatBot to recognize people's intentions by learning a model of LogisticRegression.
This chatBot can identify the user's intention and recommend him, on popular sites in the city he wants to visit, by using an API of OpenTripMap.
